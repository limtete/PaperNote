## Summary
This PHD thesis actually makes a flag and a **standard** to learn.
1. methodology-application **Architecture**: this is a good arch to plan and organize PHD career as MIT guide suggest
(think in a macro level about what you are going to do during your PHD career). Most of my consideration
focused on methodology side(knowledge graph construction/completion/representation, NRL and graph neural network,
all of these are just methods, which mean theoretical research), as Mr. Yan suggests, we should concentrate on
the application part, which makes money(his interest) and doesn't focus mathmatics background(my situation).
So what needs to do next
    1. Find one application to group all the methods i investigate these days, promising aspects
    are(**KG-based** or **GNN-based**):
        1. **Recsys**
        1. **VQA**
        1. **QA**
    1. Read GN/KG/NRL/KGL method and application at the same time: **THUNLP/GNN** has made a good classification which
    makes it a good starting point.
1. Each **part** of the **Arch** should be published as a paper

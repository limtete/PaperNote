# Unifying Knowledge Graph Learning and Recommendation: Towards a Better Understanding of User Preference
---
1. Que: KG is not complete; embedding dim(reflecting preference) is hyperparameter and unexplainable
1. main idea: implicit links exists in u-i interaction and KG that express user preference
1. basis:
  1. TransH: different r has different translation hyperplane
  1. Multi-task learning
1. solution:
  1. multi-task: KGC+RecSys
  1. relation embedding + entity embedding
1. sum:
  1. multi-task framework: mutually enhancement
  1. relation sematically embedded into structure.

# Graph Matching Networks for Learning the Similarity of Graph Structured Objects
---
1. Que: graph similarity learning(GSL): sim(G1, G2)
1. main idea: dependent matching-based embedding
  1. GNN is effective
  1. promotion: add pairwise match mechanism
  1. more general result: matching mechanism better than independant embedding on a wide range of tasks
1. method:
  1. frame:
    1. embedding: encoder(node attribution + edge attribution) --> propagation --> aggregation
    1. similarity distance
  1. matching cross-graph
1. summary:
  1. potential application: group recommendation
  1. graph network mechnism
1. self-que:
  1. what is Graph similarity?
